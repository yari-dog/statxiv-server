this is a proof of concept server

It is designed to render an arbitrary number of:

    arbitrary 1 bit bitmaps 
    
    arbitrary text (eventually)
    
    arbitrary graphics (eventually)



it is a means to an end to cement the logic required for an eventual ffxiv dalamud plugin

this plugin will accomplish the goal of showing character information (current job, hp, mp, eventually arbitrary values)

on QMK based keyboards with an OLED screen. 

This requires a keymap that includes the client C code. this will be posted at a later date.



to run:

npm install

nodemon run index.js
